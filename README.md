# Custom-tkinter-LOGIN-UI
I have created a login UI which has register and login page in custom tkinter
Created by Dreaming Moonlight, everybutton is programmed and works, still is progress. No copies orginial handwritten code.
Users can't blame that code was copied from else where because it was written from scratch and also have a recording as proff.

There are indeed a bit bugs in the program, where I would try to fix it, this is the first version so bugs are expected.

This entire code is pure python made with a package called custom tkinter, if you know tkinter is a GUI based package which helps users create GUI's in python more easily, and whereas custom tkinter is a bit different from custom tkinter, it just improves the UI design, which is far better from standard tkinter. The goal of the project was that users shall be able to login or register their account and also can send a review to the programmers. Custom tkinter is also coded a bit different anyway I have linked the main.py file where you can open and access the code.

This project is still being worked on...

Hope you enjoy and have a great day, requested to share some ideas and fixes if interested.

Regards,
Dreaming moonlight
