# Custom-tkinter-LOGIN-UI
I have created a login UI which has register and login page in custom tkinter
Created by Dreaming Moonlight, everybutton is programmed and works, still is progress. No copies orginial handwritten code.
Users can't blame that code was copied from else where because it was written from scratch and also have a recording as proff.

There are indeed a bit bugs in the program, where I would try to fix it, this is the first version so bugs are expected.

This entire code is pure python made with a package called custom tkinter, if you know tkinter is a GUI based package which helps users create GUI's in python more easily, and whereas custom tkinter is a bit different from custom tkinter, it just improves the UI design, which is far better from standard tkinter. The goal of the project was that users shall be able to login or register their account and also can send a review to the programmers. Custom tkinter is also coded a bit different anyway I have linked the main.py file where you can open and access the code.

To start off, you need a python IDE, you can use standard python IDE but recommended to use othere 3rd party apps, I personally user pyCharm and Visual studio code.

After you got your IDE setup and running you require 3 packages which are: 1) Custom tkinter, 2) Tkinter, 3) OS

installing custom tkinter --> pip install customtkinter (for version 5.1.2)
#Make sure you do not install version 3 because the ctk.set_default_color_theme does not work for some reason, where as the version 5.1.2 worked for me.

installing tkinter --> pip install tkinter

install OS --> no installation required (built in)

importing package 
custom tkinter --> import customtkinter as ctk, I used as ctk because it would take far less time to type.

tkinter message box --> import tkinter.messagebox as tkmb, again I have used as tkmb for lesser time to type.

os --> import os

after these steps you can continue your code
#source code in (main.py) file

This project is still being worked on...

Hope you enjoy and have a great day, requested to share some ideas and fixes if interested.

Dreaming moonlight
